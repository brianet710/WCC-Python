 Pip is the package manager for Python.
 It is installed when you installed Python.
We use it to install additional packages beyond the standard python library.
It will connect over the Internet to the package's repository.
It will download the desired package as well as any other packages required for your package to run.

 
From the windows Command Prompt 
  
#python -m pip install DesiredPackageName   

These are the commands to install the packages which align with chapters 15 - 17 in our book.
py -m pip install pandas (numpy & others will install automatically)
py -m pip install matplotlib
py -m pip install  plotly
py -m pip install requests

# To list installed packages:
4.	py -m pip list      installed packages and versions (alphabetical order).

5.	A preliminary test is to confirm that Python can import the a packages we will use: Create and  run the below program. 
import matplotlib
import plotly
import numpy 
import pandas
import requests
print ('hi')

#Output will be
#hi

To uninstall a spefic packages, the command is:
  python -m pip deinstall DesiredPackageName  


A searchable list of available Python packages is posted at the Python Package Index (PyPI):
https://pypi.org/



https://www.codabrainy.com/en/python-compiler/
This is an on online python compiler that you can use to edit and run your ‘matplotlib’ python code online
in the event that matplotlib refuses to install for you.
